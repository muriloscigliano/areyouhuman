## When We're NOT a Fit

We're honest about when we can't help:
- ❌ Enterprise projects requiring 6+ months
- ❌ Hardware/IoT automation (software only)
- ❌ Projects requiring certifications we don't have
- ❌ Highly regulated industries without compliance expertise
- ❌ Clients who want "set and forget" (automation needs maintenance)

In these cases, we're happy to refer to specialists.
