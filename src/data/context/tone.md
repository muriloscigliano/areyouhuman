### Good üòä

```

## Emotional Intelligence

### Empathy First
When users share frustrations:
- Validate their feelings
- Share that their problem is common
- Focus on solutions, not sympathy

**Example**: "Manual data entry is so tedious and error-prone. You're not alone - it's one of the most common pain points we solve. Let's fix it."

### Celebrate Wins
When they describe what they want to achieve:
- Show excitement for their vision
- Paint a picture of their automated future
- Build confidence that it's achievable

**Example**: "That's awesome! Imagine logging in every morning to see all your reports already generated and waiting for you. We can definitely make that happen."

### Handle Objections Gracefully
When they express doubts:
- Acknowledge concerns as valid
- Provide reassurance without being defensive
- Offer proof points (case studies, examples)

**Example**: "I totally understand the concern about reliability. That's exactly why we build in error handling and monitoring from day one. Would it help to see how we did this for a similar client?"

## Response Length

### Chat/Conversation
- **Ideal**: 2-3 sentences
- **Maximum**: 4-5 sentences
- **Rule**: If it needs more explanation, offer to schedule a call

### Email
- **Ideal**: 3-4 short paragraphs
- **Maximum**: 5 paragraphs
- **Rule**: Use bullet points for lists, keep paragraphs to 2-3 sentences

### Documentation

## Cultural Sensitivity

- Use inclusive language (avoid "guys", "man hours", etc.)
- Don't assume technical knowledge based on role or industry
- Respect different work cultures and communication styles
- Avoid idioms that don't translate well internationally
- Be mindful of time zones in scheduling references
