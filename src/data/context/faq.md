# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Are You Human?
We're an automation consultancy that helps businesses eliminate repetitive work. We connect your tools, automate workflows, and add AI to make your team more efficient.

### Who do you work with?
Small to medium businesses (5-100 employees) in e-commerce, SaaS, marketing agencies, professional services, and operations-heavy industries.

### What makes you different from hiring a developer?
We specialize in automation, so we work 3-5x faster than a general developer. We know all the tools, APIs, and best practices. Plus, we handle the entire projectâ€”discovery, design, development, and training.

### Can you work with our existing tools?
Yes! We integrate with 1000+ tools via APIs, webhooks, and platforms like Zapier, Make, and n8n. If it has an API, we can connect it.

## Pricing & Timeline

### How much does automation cost?
Projects typically range from $1,000 to $15,000 depending on complexity:
- **Simple** ($1K-3K): 1-2 tools, basic workflow
- **Medium** ($3K-8K): 3-5 tools, custom logic, dashboard
- **Complex** ($8K-15K): Enterprise integrations, AI features, custom apps

### How long does a project take?
Most projects are completed in 2-4 weeks:
- Week 1: Discovery and design
- Week 2-3: Development and testing
- Week 4: Deployment and training

### Do you charge monthly fees?
The automation itself is a one-time cost. Optional ongoing support is $200-500/month if you want maintenance, updates, and optimization.

### What if I don't have the budget right now?
We can break projects into phases! Start with the highest-impact automation first, then expand as you see ROI.

## Technical

### What if I'm not technical?
No problem! We explain everything in plain English and handle all the technical work. You just tell us what you need, and we make it happen.

### Will this break my existing systems?
No. We test thoroughly in staging environments before touching production. All changes are reversible, and we build error handling into every automation.

### What happens if something goes wrong?
You get 30 days of free support after launch. We monitor automations, fix issues quickly, and optimize performance.

### Do I need to buy new software?
Usually no. We work with your existing tools. Occasionally we might recommend a specific tool (like Zapier or Airtable), but we always discuss costs upfront.

### Can you work with custom or legacy systems?
Yes, if they have an API or database we can access. Some legacy systems are trickier, but we'll be honest about feasibility during discovery.

## Process

### How do we get started?
1. Book a discovery call (30 min, free)
2. We create a custom quote
3. You approve, we start
4. Project kicks off within 1 week

### What information do you need from us?
- List of tools you use
- Description of processes to automate
- Access to systems (with appropriate permissions)
- Time from 1-2 team members for questions

### How involved do we need to be?
Minimal! We need about 2-3 hours total:
- 1 hour: Initial discovery call
- 30 min: Mid-project check-in
- 1 hour: Training and handoff

### Do you sign NDAs?
Yes, absolutely. We sign your NDA or we can provide ours.

## Data & Security

### Will you have access to our data?
Only what's necessary for the automation. We use read-only access whenever possible and delete test data after the project.

### How do you handle sensitive information?
- We sign NDAs
- Use secure credential management (1Password, LastPass)
- Follow SOC 2 and GDPR best practices
- Delete access after project completion

### Where is data stored?
In your existing systems. We don't create new databases unless you specifically request it (for dashboards, etc.). If we do, we use secure cloud providers like Supabase or AWS.

## Results & ROI

### How do I know this will work?
We provide a detailed project plan upfront showing exactly what we'll build. You approve each stage before we proceed. Plus, you get 30 days to test and request adjustments.

### What kind of results can I expect?
Typical results:
- 50-90% reduction in manual work
- 95%+ accuracy (vs human error)
- Hours saved per week = $$ saved per year
- Faster turnaround times
- Better customer experience

### How do I measure ROI?
We help you define success metrics upfront:
- Time saved (hours/week Ã— hourly rate)
- Error reduction (cost of errors prevented)
- Revenue enabled (additional capacity)
- Customer satisfaction improvements

### What if I don't see results?
If we didn't deliver what we promised, we'll fix it or refund your money. Simple as that.

## Support & Maintenance

### What's included in the project?
- Complete automation development
- Testing and quality assurance
- Documentation
- Training for your team
- 30 days of free support

### What happens after 30 days?
You own the automation and can maintain it yourself. Or, you can opt for ongoing support ($200-500/month) for monitoring, updates, and optimization.

### Can we modify the automation ourselves?
Depends on the complexity. Simple Zapier automations? Yes. Custom code? You'll need a developer. We provide full documentation either way.

### What if we want to add features later?
Just reach out! We can add features on a project basis or include it in ongoing support.

## Specific Scenarios

### We use an obscure/industry-specific tool
If it has an API or can export data, we can likely work with it. We've integrated everything from veterinary practice management systems to construction estimating software.

### We've tried automation before and it didn't work
We hear this a lot! Usually it's because:
1. The tool wasn't the right fit
2. The automation was too rigid
3. There was no error handling
4. Nobody trained the team

We avoid these pitfalls by designing for flexibility, building in error handling, and thorough training.

### We're planning to change our tools soon
Let's wait until after the change, or build the automation on your new tools. We can also build a temporary bridge automation if you need it during the transition.

### Our processes are too complex/unique to automate
Challenge accepted! Complex processes are our specialty. Often, complexity is just lots of simple rules combined. We break it down step by step.

### We're growing fast and processes keep changing
Perfect! We build automations that are flexible and easy to modify. As you scale, your automations scale with you.

## Still Have Questions?

Just ask! We're here to help. No question is too basic or too complex.
