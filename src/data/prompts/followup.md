2. **Add Value**: Share resources, insights, or ideas in each follow-up

## Objection Handling

### "Too Expensive"
"I totally understand budget concerns. Would it help if we broke this into phases? We could start with the most impactful automation first and expand over time."

### "Need More Time"
"Of course! This is an important decision. Is there any additional information I can provide while you're considering? A demo? Reference calls with similar clients?"

### "Need to Discuss with Team"
"Absolutely. Would it be helpful if I prepared a brief presentation or joined a call to answer your team's questions?"

### "Not Sure It Will Work"
"I get it - you want to be confident this will deliver results. How about we start with a pilot project to prove the ROI before committing to the full scope?"

### "Already Have Someone/Something"
"That makes sense! Is your current solution meeting all your needs? Sometimes our clients find we can fill gaps or enhance existing systems."
