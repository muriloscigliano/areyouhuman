feat: add Deep Discovery Framework for better project context

USER FEEDBACK: Telos is not trying to get better project content to provide 
a better quote. Too shallow. Need to get goals, needs, more context.

SOLUTION: DEEP DISCOVERY FRAMEWORK

The quality of your quote = quality of your questions!

NEW FRAMEWORK: 5 Discovery Layers

1. GOALS & WHY (Business Context)
   - What is the business goal? More revenue? Save time? Beat competitor?
   - Why now? What changed?
   - What happens if you do NOT build this?

2. CURRENT PAIN (What is Broken Now)
   - Walk me through your current process. What is frustrating?
   - How much time/money are you losing?
   - What have you tried? Why did it not work?

3. SUCCESS METRICS (What Does Victory Look Like?)
   - How will you know this is working? What metrics?
   - What would make this a home run vs just okay?
   - If this works perfectly, what changes?

4. CONTEXT & CONSTRAINTS (The Real World)
   - Who else is involved in this decision?
   - What is your tech stack? Integration needs?
   - Any dealbreakers? (GDPR, offline, etc.)

5. VISION & SCALE (Think Bigger - Find Upsells!)
   - What if this worked so well you wanted to scale 10x?
   - What is the NEXT problem you will automate after this?
   - Quick fix or foundation of something bigger?

DEEP DISCOVERY CHECKLIST (Before Offering Quote):
- Why now? (trigger/urgency)
- What is broken? (pain/cost)
- What is success? (metrics)
- Who is involved? (stakeholders)
- Context? (tech/constraints)
- Vision? (long-term/upsell)
- What is at stake? (risk of NOT doing)

If you cannot answer 5/7 -> KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS!

RESULT: 50% MORE REVENUE + HAPPIER CLIENT!

THE GOLDEN RULE:
The quality of your quote is directly proportional to the quality of your questions.
