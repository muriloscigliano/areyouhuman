# 🧠 Cognitive Design Copy Guide

## What Changed

### ❌ OLD (Transactional)
```
"What's your name?"
"What's your email?"  
"What's your company?"
```
**Feels like**: Filling a form, interrogation, boring

### ✅ NEW (Conversational)
```
"Who should I make the proposal out to?"
"Where should I send your quote once it's ready?"
"What's the name of your company or brand?"
```
**Feels like**: Partnership, service, personalized

---

## Why This Works Better

### 1. **Purpose-Driven Framing**
❌ "What's your name?" → No context, sounds robotic  
✅ "Who should I make the proposal out to?" → Explains WHY you need it

### 2. **Future-Pacing**
❌ "What's your email?" → Transactional  
✅ "Where should I send your quote once it's ready?" → Creates anticipation

### 3. **Choice Architecture**
❌ "What's your company?" → Assumes they have one  
✅ "Is this under a company name, or just you?" → Feels flexible

### 4. **Playful Language**
❌ "What's your email?" → Boring  
✅ "Where should I teleport your quote?" → Fun, memorable

### 5. **Value-First**
Every question connects the ask to the benefit (getting a proposal, quote, etc.)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Vary the Copy**
Don't use the same variation every time. Rotate through options to keep it fresh.

### 2. **Match the Energy**
If user is formal → Use Variation 1  
If user is casual → Use Variation 2 or 3

### 3. **Keep the Flow**
Always ask in order: Name → Email → Company  
Never skip or reorder.

### 4. **Natural Transitions**
Use their name immediately after they give it:
> "Thanks, Sarah! Where should I send your quote?"

### 5. **Acknowledge Responses**
Before each new question, acknowledge:
> "Perfect." / "Great!" / "Got it."

## ⚠️ Anti-Patterns (Don't Do This)

### ❌ **Asking Multiple Things at Once**
```
"What's your name, email, and company?"
```
→ Overwhelming, feels like a form

### ❌ **No Acknowledgment**
```
User: "John Smith"
Telos: "What's your email?"
```
→ Sounds robotic, no warmth

### ❌ **Generic Follow-ups**
```
"What's your name?"
"What's your email?"
"What's your company?"
```
→ Boring, transactional

### ❌ **Skipping Purpose**
```
"Give me your email"
```
→ No context, feels pushy
